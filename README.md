<h1>Ordered Chained Dynamic List</h1>
This is a homework of a simple Ordered Chained Dynamic List, coded in C language, that shows the basic knowledge about of this specific structure.

<h1>How it works?</h1>
The chaining works with pointers, an element points to your next element. To know the last element is easy because it will point to NULL.<br />
The elements are sorted alphabetically.<br />
The "dynamic" means that when the user add an new element the program will allocate memory to it.<br />
The dynamic allocation and element pointer removes the need of an static array. This allows you to register new elements until you run out of memory.

<h1>How to run?</h1>
Just execute the start-app.exe      :)
